- `/getting-started/` - Installation and setup instructions
- `/config/` - Complete configuration reference with environment variables
- `/deployment-operations/` - Production deployment and operations guide
- `/integration-dashboards/` - Prometheus and Grafana integration examples

### Metrics Documentation
- `/metrics/` - Metrics reference index
- `/metrics/overview/` - High-level metrics overview and categories
- `/metrics/metrics/` - Complete detailed metrics reference

### Collector System
- `/collectors/` - Comprehensive collector reference
- `/extending-collectors/` - Guide for adding new metric collectors

### Architecture & Development
- `/adr/` - Architecture Decision Records
- `/adr/001-collector-architecture/` - Collector hierarchy and update tiers
- `/adr/002-error-handling-strategy/` - Error handling patterns
- `/patterns/` - Development patterns and best practices

## Key Features
- **Multi-tier collection system**: Fast (60s), Medium (300s), Slow (900s) update intervals
- **Specialized collectors**: Camera metrics, motion events, recording statistics, system health
- **Comprehensive metrics**: NVR status, camera health, storage usage, motion detection
- **OpenTelemetry support**: Full observability with traces, metrics, and logs
- **Production-ready**: Docker container, health checks, error handling, connection management

## API Reference
The exporter collects metrics from:
- NVR system APIs (storage, CPU, memory usage)
- Camera-specific APIs (status, recording, motion detection)
- Event APIs (motion events, smart detections)
- System health APIs

## Configuration
All configuration via environment variables with format: `UNIFI_PROTECT_EXPORTER_{SECTION}__{SETTING}`

## Technology Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.11+ with asyncio
- **Metrics**: Prometheus metrics with OpenTelemetry export
- **API**: UniFi Protect API via uiprotect SDK
- **Deployment**: Docker containers, Kubernetes support
- **Documentation**: MkDocs with Material theme

## Target Audience
- DevOps engineers implementing UniFi Protect monitoring
- Security administrators managing video surveillance infrastructure
- Site reliability engineers building observability systems
- Developers extending the collector system
